This exception happens when I deal with exercise Listing 5.16. Testing 
form-handling controller methods in Spring In Action 4th Edtion.

The way to fix it is to add constructor with non-arguments for Spitter class.
My guess is the params passed from 
SpitterControllerTest.shouldProcessRegistrationForm() failed to initiate a 
Spitter instance if there is no Constructor without parament

	public Spitter(){
		super();
	}
